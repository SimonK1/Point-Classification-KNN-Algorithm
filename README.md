# Point-Classification-KNN-Algorithm

This project was developed as a school assignment for course Artificial Intelligence (FIIT STU). The point of this project was to create a custom KNN Algorithm for simple point classification. Algorithm uses euclidean distance for finding k nearest neighbours and is creating simple visualization. This project is entirely written in Python and was developed without using any external sources. User interface, code and code comments are written in English.
